    <h1>About HNLTCS</h1>
    <p>
      This site is meant to host analytics projects from a group of college
      students. Most of the contributors do not major in mathematics or
      statistics, but all are students with a fascination for the subjects and
      their varius applications. This isn't meant to be the publication of
      experts, but rather a way to encourage us to keep working at these sorts
      of projects. Our hope is that with enough time and attempts, we can make
      something kind of cool!
    </p>
    <p>With that, we hope you enjoy our content! -HN</p>
