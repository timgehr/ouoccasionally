    <h1>About OU Occassionally</h1>
    <p>
      This is a poorly thought out and even more poorly executed satire site solely intended to emulate other satire news sites except with The *niversity *f *klahoma inspired content. See, we bleeped out the letters so you can't tell that I'm talking about it! If anyone would like to pursue legal action, please just DM us and tell us to stop, this is for the entertainment of maybe 10 people at most and is not worth any legal fees whatsoever. But before contacting us, contact SNL because OU seems to own a yearly slot on Weekend Update.

    <p>All content is entirely satirical and is not intended to represent any sort of news or facts. Do not take any advice we may post, do not take this seriously. Enjoy!</p>
